Summary 
My visualization seeks to present the reasons that can be used to explain the differences in performances of players. It mainly conveys the information that left-handed people (27% of the players) have the perform the best (i.e. highest batting averages and highest number of home runs). Also, for players, as the height increases, the batting averages decreases. On the other hand, the height vs. number of home runs graph follows a normal distribution. In order to understand the visualization, it is important that the reader understands baseball and the general ideas about baseball such as batting average and home runs. 


Design 
Design choices I made to the visualization after collecting feedback are:
- After feedback 1, I made sure that the colors are matching. I decided to keep the following colors - red, blue, orange. Then, I made sure the colors matched properly.
- After feedback 2, I created a walthrough to guide the user through the ideas. Walkthrough with several pages allows the user to clearly digest ideas. On the other hand, I have some interactions, so that the user can explore in his/her own way. 
- After feedback 3, I added a graph with showing graphs with overall values so that the user can mentally make a comparison. It has not been added as an other layer in the same graph to avoid confusion. Adding it as a new graph allows the user to explore the general trend. 

Feedback 

Questions asked:
What do you notice in the visualization [relationships]?
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?

Feedback 1:
Noted the fact that left-handed players have the highest batting averages. 
64% of the people are right handed [majority of the chart].
Suggestions made 
-> Make the colors matching. Noted the fact that the color representing "Left-handed" in the first graph [red] does not match the color representing the "Left-handed" in the second chart[blue].
-> Not sure what is the connection between the two charts. Are they supposed to represent one main idea?


Feedback 2:
Left-handed players have the highest batting averages. The interaction is helpful to understand the comparison.
Since the colors match, it became clear that left handed players [i.e 27% of the players] scored the highest number of batting averages.
Suggestions made 
-> Maybe doing a walthrough (with some comments) will helping in clearly guiding the user. There is no clear transition from the first graph to the second graph. 

Feedback 3: 
Noted all the implied relationships. 
Suggestions made:
-> It will be helpful to see how a category average compares with the overall values.
